# map_vis_soybeans_elction

I'm trying to use data analysis and visualization tools to plot the soybeans production as well as 2016 presidential election by the county level on an interactive map. The current partisan US congress (including US senate and US house) will also be displayed on the same map.

The tool used for visualizing data on a map is called [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium). It enables us to manipulate the data in Python, and then visualize it in on a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) map. The data manipulation packages we use are **pandas**, **numpy** and **json**.

I also wrote a blog post about this. Check the post on my personal website: [Here](https://shuzhanfan.github.io/2018/04/visualization-of-tarrif-and-election/).
